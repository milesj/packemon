title: pack-workspace

Like [`pack`](./build), but when ran in the monorepo root, will pack _all_ packages in the
workspace, as denoted by the `workspaces` field in `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "pack": "packemon pack-workspace --addEngines --declaration",
    "release": "yarn run pack && yarn publish"
  }
}
```

## Options

Supports all the same command line options as [`build-workspace`](./build-workspace).
