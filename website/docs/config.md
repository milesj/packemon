title: Package configuration
---

To configure a package, add a `packemon` block to their `package.json`, with any of the following
optional options. We suggest defining a platform at minimum.

```json title="package.json"
{
	"name": "package",
	"packemon": {
		"platform": "node"
	}
}
```

If you would like to support granular combinations of platforms, its formats, and supported
environments, you may pass an array of options to `packemon`. This is an advanced feature, so use
with caution.

```json title="package.json"
{
	"name": "package",
	"packemon": [
		{
			"inputs": { "index": "src/index.ts" },
			"platform": "node"
		},
		{
			"inputs": { "web": "src/web.ts" },
			"platform": "browser",
			"support": "current"
		},
		{
			"inputs": { "node": "src/node.mjs" },
			"format": "mjs",
			"platform": "node",
			"support": "experimental"
		}
	]
}
```

## Platforms

The platform in which built code will be ran.

- `browser` _(default)_ - Web browsers on desktop and mobile.
- `native` - Native devices, primarily for React Native.
- `node` - Node.js runtime.

```json
{
	"platform": "browser"
}
```

To support multiple platforms, pass an array.

```json
{
	"platform": ["browser", "node"]
}
```

> In the future, we hope to support other platforms like Electron.

## Support

The supported environment and or version for the configured platform(s).

- `legacy` - An unsupported version. Only exists for legacy projects and systems.
- `stable` _(default)_ - The oldest supported version, typically a version in LTS maintenance mode.
- `current` - The current supported LTS version.
- `experimental` - The newest version, typically not yet released for LTS. Is experimental or
  unstable.

```json
{
	"support": "current"
}
```

> We suggest leaving this setting at `stable` for all libraries, as it offers the widest range of
> support for consumers.

### Legend

The supported environments above map to the following platform targets.

|            | Legacy    | Stable              | Current        | Experimental           |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Browser    | >= IE 11  | defaults, not IE 11 | > 1%, not dead | last 2 chrome versions |
| Native     | >= iOS 8  | >= iOS 10           | >= iOS 12      | >= iOS 14              |
| Node       | >= 10.3.0 | >= 12.17.0          | >= 14.16.0     | >= 16.0.0              |
| Node (NPM) | >= 6.1.0  | >= 6.3.0            | >= 6.14.0      | >= 7.0.0               |

## Formats

The output format for each platform build target. Each format will create a folder relative to the
project root that will house the built files.

> Packemon defaults to an ECMAScript format if available.

### Browser

- `lib` _(default)_ - [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) output using `.js` file
  extension. For standard JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- `esm` _(default)_ - ECMAScript module output using `.js` file extension. The same as `lib`, but
  uses `import/export` instead of `require`.
- `umd` - Universal Module Definition output using `.js` file extension. Meant to be used directly
  in the browser (via CDN) instead of being bundled. Will be automatically enabled if
  [namespace](#namespace) is provided and using default formats.

### Native

- `lib` _(default)_ - [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) output using `.js` file
  extension. For standard JavaScript and TypeScript projects. _This is the only format supported by
  React Native and Metro._

### Node

- `lib` - [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) output using `.js` file extension. For
  standard JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- `cjs` - [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) output using `.cjs` file extension. Source
  files must be written in CommonJS (`.cjs`) and `require` paths must use trailing extensions.
- `mjs` _(default)_ - [ECMAScript module](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) output using `.mjs` file
  extension. Source files must be written in ESM (`.mjs`) and `import` paths must use trailing
  extensions.

```json
{
	"format": "lib"
}
```

To support multiple formats, or cross-platform formats, pass an array.

```json
{
	"format": ["lib", "cjs", "esm", "umd"]
}
```

## Inputs

A mapping of entry points for the library (only when [bundling](#bundle)), where the object key is
the name of the output file to be built (without extension), and the value is an input source file
relative to the package root.

```json
{
	"inputs": {
		"index": "src/index.ts",
		"client": "src/client/index.ts",
		"server": "src/server.ts"
	}
}
```

Defaults to `{ "index": "src/index.ts" }` if not defined. If you're _not_ using TypeScript, you will
need to configure this.

> These inputs can be automatically mapped to `package.json` `exports` using the `--addExports` CLI
> option. Do note that this feature is still experimental.

## Externals

By default, Packemon will denote all `package.json` dependencies (peer, dev, and prod) as Rollup
externals. If you need to define custom externals (path aliases, etc), you can utilize the
`externals` option, which accepts a string or an array of strings.

```json
{
	"externals": "some-module-name"
}
```

Externals can also be provided as regex-strings that will be used with string `match()`.

```json
{
	"externals": ["@scope/\\*"]
}
```

## Bundle

Whether to bundle the source code into a single file for each [input](#inputs). If not provided, is
`false` for `node` platform, but `true` for all other platforms.

```json
{
	"bundle": false
}
```

> Prefer the defaults as much as possible. The only time this setting should change is if the
> package should allow deep imports. For example, a component library.

## Namespace

For browsers only, this would be the name of the UMD global variable.

```json
{
	"namespace": "Packemon"
}
```
