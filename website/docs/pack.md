The `pack` command is a multi-step pre-release solution for preparing packages for distribution.
When ran, it begins by [cleaning workspaces](./clean.md), then [building all packages](./build.md),
and finally [validating all packages](./validate.md) before a release.

If any of the steps fail, a non-zero exit code will be triggered, allowing the release cycle to be
aborted.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "pack": "NODE_ENV=production packemon pack --addEngines --declaration=api",
    "release": "yarn run pack && yarn publish"
  }
}
```

> When releasing, be sure to set `NODE_ENV` to production to remove all development and testing
> configuration settings.

## Options

Pack supports all the same command line options as [`build`](./build.md). The validation step cannot
be customized and will validate _everything_ by default.
