## Shifted Node.js/npm versions and dropped v10 support

Since Node.js v12 has reached [end of life](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), Packemon now
requires at minimum v14.19 and above to run. Furthermore, we are entirely dropping v10 support, and
shifting v12 into `legacy`, v14 into `stable`, v16 into `current`, and the new v18 into
`experimental`. As part of this process, we are also bumping minimum requirements and coupled npm
versions.

The updated [`support`](../config.md#support) compatibility table is as follows.

### Before

|      | Legacy    | Stable     | Current    | Experimental |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Node | >= 10.3.0 | >= 12.17.0 | >= 14.16.0 | >= 16.0.0    |
| npm  | >= 6.1.0  | >= 6.3.0   | >= 6.14.0  | >= 7.0.0     |

### After

|      | Legacy     | Stable     | Current    | Experimental |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Node | >= 12.22.0 | >= 14.19.0 | >= 16.12.0 | >= 18.0.0    |
| npm  | >= 6.14.0  | >= 6.14.0  | >= 8.1.0   | >= 8.5.0     |

Notable changes:

- v14.19 supports
  [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V14.md#corepack)
- v16.12 supports new
  [ESM loader hooks](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V16.md#experimental-esm-loader-hooks-api)
- v18 supports native fetch and
  [OpenSSL 3.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V17.md#openssl-30)

## Removed `api` support from `--declaration`

We removed support for the `api` option, which uses
[@microsoft/api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to generate a single `.d.ts` file. This
feature was rarely used, overcomplicated the implementation, and had weird edge cases that we
couldn't solve on our end.

Because of this change, the `--declaration` option on the command line is now a flag with no value.

```shell
# Before
--declaration standard
--declaration api

# After
--declaration
```

## Removed the `--analyze` option

Since Packemon now supports [customizing the Rollup config][packemon-config], the
[rollup-plugin-visualizer](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer) plugin can now be
implemented in user-land, and doesn't need to exist in core.

```js
const path = require('path');
const visualizer = require('rollup-plugin-visualizer');

module.exports = {
	rollupInput(config) {
		config.plugins.push(
			visualizer((outputOptions) => ({
				filename: path.join(outputOptions.dir, 'stats.html'),
				gzipSize: true,
				open: true,
				sourcemap: true,
				template: 'treemap',
			})),
		);
	},
};
```

## Removed `.babelrc` support within each package

Packemon historically supported `.babelrc` files within packages as a means to allow custom Babel
plugins and presets per package. However, this wasn't really documented, and since we now support
[Packemon config files][packemon-config], we suggest using that instead.

```json title="packages/foo/.babelrc"
// Before
{
	"plugins": ["babel-plugin-formatjs"]
}
```

```js title="packages/foo/.packemon.js"
module.exports = {
	babelOutput(config) {
		config.plugins.push('babel-plugin-formatjs');
	},
};
```
