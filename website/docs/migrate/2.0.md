## Removed `api` support from `--declaration`

We removed support for the `api` option, which uses
[@microsoft/api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to generate a single `.d.ts` file. This
feature was rarely used, overcomplicated the implementation, and had weird edge cases that we
couldn't solve on our end.

Because of this change, the `--declaration` option on the command line is now a flag with no value.

```shell
# Before
--declaration standard
--declaration api

# After
--declaration
```
