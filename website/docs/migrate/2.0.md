## Removed `api` support from `--declaration`

We removed support for the `api` option, which uses
[@microsoft/api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to generate a single `.d.ts` file. This
feature was rarely used, overcomplicated the implementation, and had weird edge cases that we
couldn't solve on our end.

Because of this change, the `--declaration` option on the command line is now a flag with no value.

```shell
# Before
--declaration standard
--declaration api

# After
--declaration
```

````
visualizer((outputOptions) => ({
				filename: path.join(outputOptions.dir!, artifact.getStatsFileName()),
				gzipSize: true,
				open: true,
				sourcemap: true,
				template: features.analyze as 'treemap',
				title: artifact.getStatsTitle(),
			})),
			```
````
