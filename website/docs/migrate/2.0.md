## Removed `api` support from `--declaration`

We removed support for the `api` option, which uses
[@microsoft/api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to generate a single `.d.ts` file. This
feature was rarely used, overcomplicated the implementation, and had weird edge cases that we
couldn't solve on our end.

Because of this change, the `--declaration` option on the command line is now a flag with no value.

```shell
# Before
--declaration standard
--declaration api

# After
--declaration
```

## Removed the `--analyze` option

Since Packemon now supports [customizing the Rollup config][packemon-config], the
[rollup-plugin-visualizer](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer) plugin can now be
implemented in user-land, and doesn't need to exist in core.

```js
const path = require('path');
const visualizer = require('rollup-plugin-visualizer');

module.exports = {
	rollupInput(config) {
		config.plugins.push(
			visualizer((outputOptions) => ({
				filename: path.join(outputOptions.dir, 'stats.html'),
				gzipSize: true,
				open: true,
				sourcemap: true,
				template: 'treemap',
			})),
		);
	},
};
```

## Removed `.babelrc` support within each package

Packemon historically supported `.babelrc` files within packages as a means to allow custom Babel
plugins and presets per package. However, this wasn't really documented, and since we now support
[Packemon config files][packemon-config], we suggest using that instead.

```json title="packages/foo/.babelrc"
// Before
{
	"plugins": ["babel-plugin-formatjs"]
}
```

```js title="packages/foo/.packemon.js"
module.exports = {
	babelOutput(config) {
		config.plugins.push('babel-plugin-formatjs');
	},
};
```
