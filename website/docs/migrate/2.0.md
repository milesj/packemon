## Dropped UMD support

Dropped support for the `umd` format and the `namespace` configuration option for 2 reasons:

- With the change of only supporting 1 format, it's no longer possible to build `umd` alongside
  `lib` or `esm`.
- UMD as a module format is fading away in popularity. We suggest using ES modules instead.

```diff
{
	"platform": "browser",
+	"format": "esm",
-	"format": ["esm", "umd"],
-	"namespace": "App"
}
```

## Removed `api` support from `--declaration`

We removed support for the `api` option, which uses
[@microsoft/api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to generate a single `.d.ts` file. This
feature was rarely used, overcomplicated the implementation, and had weird edge cases that we
couldn't solve on our end.

Because of this change, the `--declaration` option on the command line is now a flag with no value.

```shell
# Before
--declaration standard
--declaration api

# After
--declaration
```

## Removed the `--analyze` option

Since Packemon now supports
[customizing the Rollup config](../advanced#customizing-babel-and-rollup), the
[rollup-plugin-visualizer](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer) plugin can now be
implemented in user-land, and doesn't need to exist in core.

```js
const path = require('path');
const visualizer = require('rollup-plugin-visualizer');

module.exports = {
	rollupInput(config) {
		config.plugins.push(
			visualizer((outputOptions) => ({
				filename: path.join(outputOptions.dir, 'stats.html'),
				gzipSize: true,
				open: true,
				sourcemap: true,
				template: 'treemap',
			})),
		);
	},
};
```
