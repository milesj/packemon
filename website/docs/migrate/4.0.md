## Shifted supported platform versions

Since Node.js v16 has reached [end of life](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), Packemon now
requires at minimum v18.12 and above to run. Furthermore, we're entirely dropping v14 support, and
shifting v16 into `legacy`, v18 into `stable`, v20 into `current`, and the new v21 into
`experimental`. As part of this process, we are also bumping minimum requirements and coupled npm
versions.

The updated [`support`](../config.md#support) compatibility table is as follows.

#### Before

|          | Legacy     | Stable     | Current    | Experimental |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| node     | >= 14.15.0 | >= 16.12.0 | >= 18.12.0 | >= 19.0.0    |
| npm      | >= 6.14.0  | >= 8.1.0   | >= 8.19.0  | >= 9.0.0     |
| electron | >= 7       | >= 11      | >= 16      | >= 21        |
| native   | iOS 13     | iOS 14     | iOS 15     | iOS 16       |

#### After

|          | Legacy     | Stable     | Current    | Experimental |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| node     | >= 16.12.0 | >= 18.12.0 | >= 20.10.0 | >= 21.6.0    |
| npm      | >= 8.1.0   | >= 8.19.0  | >= 10.0.0  | >= 10.4.0    |
| electron | >= 11      | >= 16      | >= 21      | >= 26        |
| native   | iOS 14     | iOS 15     | iOS 16     | iOS 17       |

Notable Node.js changes:

- Supports `fetch` natively.
- Registering ESM hooks.
- `import.meta.resolve()`
- `--experimental-detect-module`
- `--experimental-default-type`

## Packemon is now ESM only

## React Native now supports `esm` target

## Streamlined exports and the `default` condition
